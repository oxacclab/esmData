Lab data from the Exploring Social Metacognition Dots Task
}
\note{
This dataset cannot be loaded using the
\code{\link{select_experiment}} function. It should instead be loaded using
\code{\link{data}}.

Data collected from a lab-based behavioural psychological experiment in
which participants view two boxes containing around 200 dots each and make a
decision as to whether the left or the right box contains more dots. On most
trials, participants receive advice from an advisor and make a final
decision. Both the initial and final decision are made on a horizontal bar
with the extremes representing certainty that the box on that side had the
most dots, and the middle region representing relative uncertainty.
