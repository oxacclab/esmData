#' Data collected from a series of behavioural psychological experiments in
#' which participants view two boxes containing around 200 dots each and make a
#' decision as to whether the left or the right box contains more dots. On most
#' trials, participants receive advice from an advisor and make a final
#' decision. Both the initial and final decision are made on a horizontal bar
#' with the extremes representing certainty that the box on that side had the
#' most dots, and the middle region representing relative uncertainty.
#'
#' This dataset contains many experiments on this theme, as well as metadata
#' which provides basic information about each individual study.
